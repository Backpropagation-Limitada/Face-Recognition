Here you will build a face recognition system. Many of the ideas presented here are from [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf). In lecture, we also talked about [DeepFace](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification.pdf). \n","\n","Face recognition problems commonly fall into two categories: \n","\n","- **Face Verification** - \"is this the claimed person?\". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem. \n","- **Face Recognition** - \"who is this person?\". For example, the video lecture showed a face recognition video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs) of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem. \n","\n","FaceNet learns a neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. By comparing two such vectors, you can then determine if two pictures are of the same person.\n","    \n","**In this assignment, you will:**\n","- Implement the triplet loss function\n","- Use a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings\n","- Use these encodings to perform face verification and face recognition\n","\n","In this exercise, we will be using a pre-trained model which represents ConvNet activations using a \"channels first\" convention, as opposed to the \"channels last\" convention used in lecture and previous programming assignments. In other words, a batch of images will be of shape $(m, n_C, n_H, n_W)$ instead of $(m, n_H, n_W, n_C)$. Both of these conventions have a reasonable amount of traction among open-source implementations; there isn't a uniform standard yet within the deep learning community. \n","\n","Let's load the required packages. \n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"WPal_ks8PYGM","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["#Celda para agregar el path en donde se van a ubicar fr_utils e inception_blocks_v2\n","\n","import os, sys\n","ADDITIONS = 'C:\\\\Users\\\\pc\\\\.spyder-py3\\\\'\n","sys.path.append(ADDITIONS)\n","\n","\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"5lCUfl-zPYGO","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["from keras.models import Sequential\n","from keras.layers import Conv2D, ZeroPadding2D, Activation, Input, concatenate\n","from keras.models import Model\n","from keras.layers.normalization import BatchNormalization\n","from keras.layers.pooling import MaxPooling2D, AveragePooling2D\n","from keras.layers.merge import Concatenate\n","from keras.layers.core import Lambda, Flatten, Dense\n","from keras.initializers import glorot_uniform\n","from keras.engine.topology import Layer\n","from keras import backend as K\n","K.set_image_data_format('channels_first')\n","import cv2\n","import os\n","import numpy as np\n","from numpy import genfromtxt\n","import pandas as pd\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","from fr_utils import *\n","from inception_blocks_v2 import *\n","\n","%matplotlib inline\n","%load_ext autoreload\n","%autoreload 2\n","\n","np.set_printoptions(threshold=np.nan)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"IYBv5n6bPYGR","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 0 - Naive Face Verification\n","\n","In Face Verification, you're given two images and you have to tell if they are of the same person.
